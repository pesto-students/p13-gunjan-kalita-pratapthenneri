      <h3><u>Ancient history</u></h3>
      <p class="ancient">
        Tirupati has a long and rich history. It was developed by the Pallava
        Kings from the 6th century onwards. During the 11th century, it became a
        significant Vaishnava center under the influence of Ramanujacharya,
        spreading Srivaishnavism to other parts of Andhra Desa. The city
        survived Muslim invasions by agreeing to pay Jizya to the Muslims. In
        the early 1300s, during the Muslim invasion of South India, the deity of
        Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple, Srirangam, was brought to Tirupati for
        safekeeping. For most of the medieval era, Tirupati was part of the
        Vijayanagara Empire until the 17th century. The Vijayanagara rulers,
        such as Krishna Deva Raya and Achyuta Deva Raya, contributed
        considerable resources and wealth to the city. Tirupati boasts numerous
        historical temples, with the Venkateshvara Temple being one of the most
        prominent. This temple bears 1,150 inscriptions in Sanskrit, Telugu,
        Kannada, and Tamil languages. These inscriptions highlight the
        contributions of various dynasties like Pallava, Chola, Pandya, Saluva,
        Achyuta Deva Raya, Sadasiva Raya, and Aravidu. During the 15th century,
        Sri Tallapaka Annamacharya, a great composer, sung many songs praising
        Tirupati's divinity. He compared the town to heaven on earth, including
        its rocks, streams, trees, and animals. One example of such a song is:
      </p>

      <div class="song">
        <p>Kattedura Vaikuntamu Kaanachaina Konda</p>
        <p>Thettalaya Mahimale Tirumala Konda ||</p>
        <p>Vedamulae Silalai Velasinadi Konda</p>
        <p>Yedesa Punya Rasule Yerulainadi Konda</p>
        <p>Gadili Brahmadi Lokamula Konalu</p>
        <p>Konda Sree Devudundeti Seshadri Konda ||</p>
      </div>

      <div class="songmeaning">
        <p>
          Tirumala is a heavenly place with incredible powers. It is said that
          the Vedas themselves have taken the form of rocks there. Holy water
          flows as streams on Tirumala, and its peaks are considered to be like
          the realms of the gods, including Brahmaloka. Srinivasa, a deity,
          resides on Seshadri hill.
        </p>

      <p>
        Until the year 1500, there were no human settlements in Lower Tirupati.
        The importance of Upper Tirupati grew, and a village was established at
        the present-day Kapilatheertham Road area called "kotturu." Later, the
        village was moved closer to the Govindarajaswamy Temple, which was
        consecrated around 1130 CE. Over time, the village expanded around the
        Govindaraja Swamy Temple and became the city as it is now. It has become
        a popular tourist destination.
